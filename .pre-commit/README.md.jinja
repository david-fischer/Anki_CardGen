## ❓ About

Anki is a powerful tool for reviewing flash cards, in particular for learning languages.

Having flash cards with multiple cues (image, audio, example sentence, ...) is beneficial for memorization but one does not want to spend a large amount of time on the creation of the cards. This project aims to provide a solution to this process. The app automatically downloads and processes data for a given word in the target language and offers the user a choice of various options for the content of the card.

This allows quick generation of high-quality, personalized cards.

## ⚡ Quick Start

You can install the [current version](https://github.com/david-fischer/Anki_CardGen/tree/data/android) of the Android-apk and try it out. So far it is only tested on an S5 Neo.

> **⚠️ Not yet working:** The packaged application is also available as a single-file executable for [linux](https://github.com/david-fischer/Anki_CardGen/raw/data/linux/AnkiCardGen) and [windows](https://github.com/david-fischer/Anki_CardGen/raw/data/windows/AnkiCardGen.exe).

## 🏗 Current State

* [x] Processing of single words
* [x] Batch-import from .txt and **from kindle-notes**
* [x] Queue-system for words that have not been processed
* [x] Overview over processed words and option to export as .apkg (**mobile app lacks proper management of paths**)
* [ ] change of languages
* [ ] spacy on mobile
* [ ] pyinstaller workflows for windows and linux
* [ ] installation via setup.py
* [ ] executables for windows and linux
* [ ] clean-up package-structure, imports and file-paths

## 🚧 Installation

* Setup new virtual environment with python 3.7, e.g. with conda

```
conda create -n "environment_name" python==3.7
```

* install application

```
pip install git+https://github.com/david-fischer/Anki_CardGen.git
```

* Install [spacy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) model, e.g. for portuguese:

```
python -m spacy download pt_core_news_sm
```

**NOTE:** This model is used to find the dictionary form of words (e.g. casas -> casa). It is optional and does not yet work on the mobile version.


## 🎯 Troubleshooting

* python==3.7

## 🔧 Usage

After installation you should be able to start the app from the command line:
```
acg
```


## 🚀 Contribute
* So far, the project only supports Brasilian Portuguese, as it is the language I am currently learning.
  Feel free to contribute e.g. by implementing crawlers for the necessary information for words in other languages as well.
* Unfortunately, I had problems building SpaCy (more precisely its dependency blis) on arm. I therefore removed it from the dependencies in buildozer.spec and built the code to work around it if the package is not present.
