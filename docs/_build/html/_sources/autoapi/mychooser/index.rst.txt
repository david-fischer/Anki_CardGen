.. py:class:: CheckBehavior(**kwargs)

   Bases: :class:`mychooser.MultiStateBehaviour`


.. py:class:: CheckContainer(**kwargs)

   Bases: :class:`kivy.uix.widget.Widget`

   Widget class. See module documentation for more information.

   :Events:
       `on_touch_down`: `(touch, )`
           Fired when a new touch event occurs. `touch` is the touch object.
       `on_touch_move`: `(touch, )`
           Fired when an existing touch moves. `touch` is the touch object.
       `on_touch_up`: `(touch, )`
           Fired when an existing touch disappears. `touch` is the touch
           object.
       `on_kv_post`: `(base_widget, )`
           Fired after all the kv rules associated with the widget
           and all other widgets that are in any of those rules have had
           all their kv rules applied. `base_widget` is the base-most widget
           whose instantiation triggered the kv rules (i.e. the widget
           instantiated from Python, e.g. ``MyWidget()``).

           .. versionchanged:: 1.11.0

   .. warning::
       Adding a `__del__` method to a class derived from Widget with Python
       prior to 3.4 will disable automatic garbage collection for instances
       of that class. This is because the Widget class creates reference
       cycles, thereby `preventing garbage collection
       <https://docs.python.org/2/library/gc.html#gc.garbage>`_.

   .. versionchanged:: 1.0.9
       Everything related to event properties has been moved to the
       :class:`~kivy.event.EventDispatcher`. Event properties can now be used
       when contructing a simple class without subclassing :class:`Widget`.

   .. versionchanged:: 1.5.0
       The constructor now accepts on_* arguments to automatically bind
       callbacks to properties or events, as in the Kv language.
