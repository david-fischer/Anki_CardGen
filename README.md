[Kivy](https://kivy.org/) App (mobile/dektop) for quick generation of personalized flash cards for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) with:
* Image
* Audio
* Example
* Synonym - Antonym
* Definition
 
Currently supported languages:
* Brazilian Portuguese


## ‚ùì About 
Anki is a powerful tool for reviewing flash cards, in particular for language learning.
While having flash cards with multiple cues (image, audio, example, ...) is beneficial, one does not want to spend a large amount of time in the creation. This project aims to provide the solution to this process
by automatically downloading and processing data for a given word in the target language. Then it offers the user a choice of various options for the content of the card.
This allows quick generation of high-quality, personalized cards.
