[Kivy](https://kivy.org/) App (mobile/dektop) for quick generation of personalized flash cards for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) with:

* Image
* Audio
* Example
* Synonym - Antonym
* Definition

Currently supported languages:
* Brazilian Portuguese


## ‚ùì About 
Anki is a powerful tool for reviewing flash cards, in particular for language learning.
While having flash cards with multiple cues (image, audio, example, ...) is beneficial, one does not want to spend a large amount of time in the creation. This project aims to provide the solution to this process
by automatically downloading and processing data for a given word in the target language. Then it offers the user a choice of various options for the content of the card.
This allows quick generation of high-quality, personalized cards.

## üèó Current State

* [x] Importing a list of words
    * [x] User interface to load
        * [x] from exported kindle-notes in html-format

    * [x] Pre-Processing
        * [x] Extracting the words
        * [x] Removal of punctuation
        * [x] Get dictionary form of word
    * [ ] Clicking on loaded words to start generation-process
* [ ] Processing single words
    * [x] Fetching necessary data to build card
    * [x] Provide user interface to select content of card
    * [x] Process the user input
    * [x] Downloading image and audio files
    * [x] Building the Anki card from html-templates
